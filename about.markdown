Welcome to by blog.  
I love writing about software engineering, leadership and anything in between.  
The blog is meant to be a practical guide for real-life situations.  
Currently I'm leading multiple teams in Amazon and in charge of all the SDKs we have in AWS. I enjoy enabling people to build amazing products.  
Before AWS, I worked at Facebook where I worked on FB stories and helped billion people to connect by sharing moments of their lives. Before Facebook, I started 3 companies across Israel.  

In my free time, I love taking long walks while listening to audiobooks (follow me on GoodReads). I’m also into Jiu-Jitsu and I consider myself lucky if I don’t get hurt once a month.  

Fun fact - I’m a private pilot so if you ever need a ride just let me know! You will need to provide the airplane though ✈️  

GLHF :)
