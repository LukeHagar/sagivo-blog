More than 10 years ago I started my first startup - [HomeDine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVS1xcd7DU8&t=4s). It was an epic fail, e.g learned a lot!  
After a few startup attempts I've decided to join the big tech companies to learn better how great companies operate.

I've spent the past few years in great companies like Facebook and Amazon. I knew my time there will not last long. I didn't want it to last long. I am an entrepreneur who likes to build things.  
During my tenure there my notebook was always open. I took so many notes on what to do (and what not to do) when operating a company. I learned process, reviews, communication and most of all - how to manage and lead other people.  
But time has passed and from a quick visit I've found myself in the corporate world for more than 5 years. I enjoyed my new comfort zone.  
Around me, people started new companies, asked me for advice and took risks. I stayed in my golden cage and only observed from afar.

In 2021 I lost a close family member. After this tragedy I needed a break, I took time off everything to recharge and reflect. More than enything, losing someone you love reminds us how short life is. There's no time for fighting over climbing the corporate ladder, there's no time for [bulshit jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs) and there is no time to stay in your comfort zone.

Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite presidents. Mainly because Roosevelt [used his authority](https://www.doi.gov/blog/conservation-legacy-theodore-roosevelt) to establish 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, four national game preserves, five national parks and 18 national monuments on over 230 million acres of public land.  
And if this is not enough, we have this quote from him:

> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

My personal loss reminded me of this quote. It's time to move on. **It's time to get back to the arena**.

This is my first post for 2022 and I'm proud to say - I'm back!  
I'm starting a new company, I'm getting back to the game and I'm ready to leave my comfort zone once again.

Here's for the ones who're in the arena - never settle, keep on fighting and remember - life is short.

PS - if you want to join the arena and fight next to me, [send me a note](mailto:sagiv@sagivo.com).

2022 - Let's do it!
